- Has indestructive walls: No
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Hank | Berry | Stu | Janet
- Last Pick: Melodie | Carl | Frank | Kenji | El Primo | Rosa | Ollie | Lou | Hank | Berry | Stu | Janet
- Other Picks: Surge | Sandy | Otis | Nita | Griff | Poco | Ash | Maisie | Max | Juju | Squeak | Meeple | Bea | Ruffs | Buster | Draco | Rico | Mr. P | Ollie | Lou | Hank | Berry | Stu | Janet
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Center Stage in Brawl Ball, the current meta heavily revolves around Ollie and Hank, who are the best brawlers in the game and should always be either banned or prioritized. They are even very good options even if we are not in phase 1. Hank with Hypercharge is incredibly dominant, capable of wiping an entire team, especially when paired with a wall-breaker; even if he dies multiple times, once he gets Hypercharge, he can easily turn the game around. Ollie, after his recent buff, is incredibly strong due to his jump gadget and super, allowing him to create massive space by quickly traversing the map and hypnotizing enemies for 3.5 seconds if he lands after using his gadget, making him extremely difficult to counter. Lou is another strong pick due to his ability to provide strong control. The recommended draft strategy is to pick a control brawler, an anti-tank, and either an assassin or a tank, which is particularly important in Brawl Ball. Berry is a great option, especially when paired with high-HP brawlers, allowing him to pop off effectively, but he is less effective at lower ranks or when playing with randoms, as teammates may not position correctly to get the most value out of his super. Stu is a strong choice but can struggle against Poco and brawlers with gadget spam. Griff is rising in popularity due to his ability to counter tanks effectively with his gadget. Otis is particularly effective on this map when equipped with the vision gear, making him a strong lane pick. Sandy, while being slightly outranged by other lane brawlers, remains a flexible pick due to his ability to charge his super against tanks and provide strong area control once it's active. Maisie is excellent as a cleanup brawler, especially when used to finish off weakened enemies. Meeple can be a solid choice if paired with anti-tank brawlers. Rosa, when picked late in the draft and equipped with the Grow gadget, can be very effective in controlling certain areas of the map. El Primo is a strong counter to certain assassins and other tanks, making him a viable situational pick. Additionally, Ruffs has become more viable again due to the return of strong gadget utility. The best approach to drafting on this map is to focus on wall-breakers, anti-tanks, and strong lane control brawlers while considering how to counter enemy tanks and assassins effectively.

Pinball Dreams:
- Mode: Brawl Ball
- Has indestructive walls: No
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Juju
- Last Pick: Melodie | Dynamike | Frank | Kenji | El Primo | Shade | Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Juju
- Other Picks: Max | Griff | Meeple | Nita | Larry | Poco | Ash | Maisie | Sandy | Berry | Squeak | Janet | Surge | Barley | Rico | Willow | Cordelius | Mr. P | Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Juju
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Pinball Dreams, Ollie is undoubtedly the best brawler due to his ability to instantly use his jump gadget to engage throwers or lane brawlers, almost guaranteeing a kill if he lands on them while also creating massive space. Lou remains an essential pick to counter tanks effectively. Stu is still versatile despite being slightly countered in the current meta, as he can break walls and continuously charge his super against tanks and other brawlers. Bea is an exceptionally strong choice on this map, especially with Rattled Hive and Hypercharge; while the Hypercharge is not essential, the gadget spam makes her even more oppressive. Hank is another top-tier pick, capable of high-impact plays. Juju and Max provide excellent counterplay, particularly against Bea and other mid-range brawlers. Griff remains one of the best anti-tank options in the game, with his gadget enabling him to break walls and counter picks like throwers or Rico, making him highly effective when paired with Bea or another long-range brawler. Additionally, there is room for cheesy compositions such as Poco and Frank, which can overwhelm opponents if they lack the damage output to stop them. However, an important draft rule is to avoid picking two low-DPS brawlers, as that will allow the enemy to run down compositions with Poco and a tank, Bea and a tank, or Max and a tank, which are all viable strategies. Likewise, if they play brawlers with low DPS, these will be good options to respond, as long as we are in an advanced phase. Last-pick throwers like Dynamike can work well, while Melodie is also a very strong last-pick option in the current meta. Shade has become more viable with recent gadget changes, adding another possible pick. Rico is becoming less effective, while Maisie is benefiting from this shift in the meta. To succeed on this map, prioritize aggressive initiators, anti-tank options, and mid-range control brawlers while being mindful of enemy team compositions that can exploit low DPS setups.

Sneaky Fields:
- Mode: Brawl Ball
- Has indestructive walls: No
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Janet
- Last Pick: Melodie | Carl | Frank | Kenji | El Primo | Rosa |  Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Janet
- Other Picks: Max | Griff | Meeple | Nita | Spike | Poco | Ash | Maisie | Sandy | Berry | Squeak | Otis | Surge | Ruffs | Juju | Draco | Rico | Mr. P |  Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Janet
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Sneaky Fields, the current meta heavily revolves around Ollie being an exceptional pick due to his jump gadget, allowing him to engage throwers or lane brawlers and secure kills while creating immense space. Hank is very dominant, especially when he has Hypercharge, as he can wipe entire teams, making him a priority pick or ban. Bea is extremely strong on this map when using the Vision Gear and Rattled Hive, providing massive lane coverage; failing to include at least one brawler with Vision Gear is a major mistake, as it allows opponents to dominate the bushes and control the map. Janet is another top-tier pick due to her Vision Gear and scouting gadget, giving her excellent bush control. Meeple is very strong in high-level play on this map but needs to be paired with a tank to maximize effectiveness. Spike is a surprising but effective pick, especially when using the Fertilize ability, as the map’s closed lanes ensure he consistently lands shots, making him a solid anti-tank and providing healing sustain. Tanks are generally strong here, with Ash being incredibly dominant. Poco is an excellent counter to Lou when using Protective Tunes, and he synergizes well with Max due to his healing spam, allowing sustained pressure. Sandy is making a comeback as a viable pick, offering strong control and synergy with tanks. Squeak is highly effective as a later draft pick, especially with the Windup gadget, allowing him to apply immense pressure. Ruffs remains valuable due to his ability to spam supers and open up the map, countering short-range casters or brawlers and even Rico. The same applies to Griff with his gagdet that allows him to break all walls. Last-pick options include Jacky, who can capitalize on her speed gadget, and El Primo, who serves as a reliable counter to enemy tanks, always checking that there are no enemy brawlers that counter them. Melodie is another powerful choice, particularly in the hands of skilled players who can maximize her Hypercharge potential. Overall, the best draft approach on this map involves securing strong lane control, vision-based picks to counter bush-dependent strategies, and a balanced composition that includes a mix of tanks, anti-tank brawlers, and aggressive playmakers.

Double Swoosh:
- Mode: Gem Grab
- Has indestructive walls: Yes
- 1st Pick: Janet | Ollie | Mr. P | Penny |  Hank | Gene
- Last Pick: Melodie | Carl | Frank | Juju | Mortis | Rosa | Janet | Ollie | Mr. P | Penny |  Hank | Gene
- Other Picks: Pearl | Amber | Surge | Stu | Otis | Lou | Sandy | Ash | Draco | Squeak | Nita | Buster | Kit | Bo | Tara | Max | Crow | Jessie | Janet | Ollie | Mr. P | Penny |  Hank | Gene
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Double Swoosh in Gem Grab, Mr. P is one of the strongest picks because his Hypercharge. Once obtained, it allows him to dominate the mid and secure victory through sheer pressure. If you recommend Mr. P, it is important to mention in the justification that the pick should be made only if you have the hypercharge. Janet is another top-tier pick due to her overpowered Hypercharge and her gadget, which provides essential bush scouting. Penny is a strong mid pick and a great counter to Mr. P, with her turret providing excellent defensive utility when placed in a safe spot. Gene is another viable mid option, especially with the Vision Gear, allowing him to control bushes effectively. Pearl excels in lane due to her ability to charge up safely and then use her gadget for high burst damage, making it difficult to push against her in this map’s bush-heavy layout. Amber is another strong lane pick, providing area denial with her super and the ability to burn bushes, which is crucial against bush-heavy strategies. Although she has become slightly weaker in the meta, she remains a solid choice. Surge benefits greatly from the Speed Gear, making him highly effective at controlling lanes. Stu is still useful despite being slightly weaker in the current meta; his Speed Zone provides valuable mobility, and he can flex between playing mid and lane as needed. Otis is a strong pick with very few direct counters, especially when using the Vision Gear and the Fat Splatter gadget to control enemy movement. Sandy is a powerful pick but should be drafted later, as he is vulnerable to being outranged and countered. He can, however, cycle his super efficiently once obtained. Ash is a devastating pick, viable even outside of last-pick scenarios due to his dominance in the current meta. Buster and Draco are also strong options on this map, with both having strong synergy with Kit, which is an advanced pick in the draft. Kit is particularly effective when positioned in the left bush alongside the gem carrier, as it can punish aggressive enemy pushes, making it a high-level pro strategy that requires coordination but is very effective. Squeak is another underrated but strong pick, especially with the Windup gadget, allowing him to dominate as a mid-lane brawler. Against mid-HP brawlers, a single gadget activation followed by an attack can often secure kills, except against tanks. Mortis is a viable last-pick counter if the enemy comp allows it. Rosa is another powerful last-pick option when equipped with the Grow Light gadget, as she can easily take over if the enemy lacks a way to break walls or burn bushes—making Amber an essential counterpick. If left unchecked, Rosa can completely overrun opponents. The same principle applies to Melodie, who is another strong pick that can dominate if the enemy fails to counter her. The best drafting strategy for Double Swoosh involves securing at least one wall breaker or a grass-burning option (as Amber), maintaining strong lane control, and balancing between aggressive playmakers and defensive support to avoid being overrun by tank-heavy or bush-dependent compositions.

Hard Rock Mine:
- Mode: Gem Grab
- Has indestructive walls: Yes
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Mr. P | Hank | Rico | Stu
- Last Pick: Melodie | Carl | Frank | Kenji | Mortis | Rosa | Ollie | Mr. P | Hank | Rico | Stu | Juju
- Other Picks: Gene | Meeple | Ruffs | Janet | Penny | Ash | Lou | Squeak | Max | Gus | Griff | Sandy | Bea | Surge | Buster | Draco | Otis | Maisie | Ollie | Mr. P | Hank | Rico | Stu | Juju
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Hard Rock Mine in Gem Grab, the best picks are Ollie, Mr. P, and Hank due to their ability to control lanes and apply immense pressure. If they are not available, then Rico or Stu could be very good options, especially as a first pick, or even Juju. Mr. P is especially dominant once he gets his Hypercharge, making him a game-changing brawler. He can be played both as a mid and a lane, and while his gadget Port of Reinforcements isn’t the best overall, it is still very effective in draft since it allows him to spam attacks, waste enemy ammo, and disrupt single-shot brawlers like Bea, Meeple, Gene or Angelo. Hank remains one of the strongest picks when he has Hypercharge, and Ollie is exceptional at aggressive engagements, providing strong map control. Juju is a good pick in this map, as he can remain safe within the grass while exerting pressure. Stu is a highly flexible pick, with Speed Zone for mobility or his wall-breaking gadget if needed. Rico is a strong draft option due to his lane control potential, where if it is accompanied with a vision gear it is a very good option. However, Ruffs is currently a more effective pick in draft, particularly with his rocket gadget, allowing him to spam attacks, dominate lanes, and provide high-control supers that can shift the match in his favor. Gene is another excellent mid option, offering vision control and his game-changing pull ability. Meeple is a strong choice, as his dice gadget allows him to box in the enemy gem carrier, setting up easy kills with his super. If Meeple struggles with range, he can use his gadget to push forward and create openings for eliminations. Ash is another excellent pick in an advanced draft (for phases 3 and 4, or even 2), especially for aggressive lane play, as he can effectively pressure the enemy gem carrier. When drafting, it is critical to have at least one aggressive brawler to punish the enemy gem carrier and apply pressure while also including an anti-tank option. A common mistake in drafting is selecting too many control-based brawlers without aggression, which makes the composition vulnerable to tank-heavy and aggressive strategies. The best approach for this map is to create a well-balanced team with aggression, sustain, and anti-tank capabilities, ensuring the ability to adapt and counter enemy picks effectively.

Undermine:
- Mode: Gem Grab
- Has indestructive walls: No
- 1st Pick: Janet | Ollie | Mr. P | Hank | Stu | Juju
- Last Pick: Melodie | Carl | Frank | Leon | Mortis | Rosa | Janet | Ollie | Mr. P | Hank | Stu | Juju
- Other Picks: Gus | Meeple | Ruffs | Penny | Ash | Otis | Lou | Buster | Max | Squeak | Surge | Sandy | Bea | Gene | Maisie | Draco | Griff | Amber | Janet | Ollie | Mr. P | Hank | Stu | Juju
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Undermine in Gem Grab, Janet is one of the best picks due to her versatility, as she can be played both as a mid and a lane. Her gadget provides full lane scouting, making her exceptionally strong for bush control. Mr. P is another top-tier pick, offering strong mid and lane presence, especially once his Hypercharge is activated. His Port of Reinforcements gadget is key for spamming and forcing enemies to waste ammo, which is particularly effective against single-shot brawlers like Bea, Meeple, Gene or Angelo. Ollie remains a dominant pick due to his aggressive playstyle, mobility, and ability to create space. Hank is also a powerful option, as his Hypercharge enables massive impact plays. Stu provides high mobility and can be used with either Speed Zone for team mobility or his wall-breaking gadget to open the map if needed. Juju remains a solid pick, being effective at controlling space and holding ground in bushes. Gus is an excellent mid pick on this map, offering survivability through his shield and knockback mechanics, making him a very safe and defensive choice. Ruffs is another strong lane brawler, using his gadget spam to control space, and even against difficult matchups like tanks, he can open up the map and charge his super quickly to support his teammates. Penny is a highly effective mid, with her turret providing a strong zoning tool that is difficult for enemies to remove. Ash remains one of the most oppressive tanks in the game, especially with Hypercharge, as there are very few solid anti-tank options available. The main tank counters right now are Lou, Griff, and Otis, making them crucial picks against tank-heavy drafts. Since good anti-tank options are scarce, healer compositions with a tank can also be a viable draft strategy. Buster is another very strong option, as his super can cover an entire lane, providing both offensive and defensive utility. Squeak is particularly strong in this meta, as he can eliminate most brawlers except tanks with just a Windup gadget and a normal attack. He is especially effective against control brawlers such as Janet, Stu, Ruffs, and Penny, making him a strong pick when facing those comps. Sandy is another viable pick, taking advantage of bushes to ambush opponents and cycle supers efficiently. Draco can be a strong pick in the right hands but requires a skilled player to be effective. Rosa is a great last-pick option, especially with the Grow Light gadget, but only if the enemy lacks wall breakers or hard counters. Mortis can also be viable as a last pick under similar conditions. Melody and Leon are additional strong options, particularly when using gadget spam to assist the gem carrier. The optimal draft strategy for Undermine involves securing a balance of lane control, bush scouting, and anti-tank capabilities while being aware of enemy compositions to counter tank-based or control-heavy setups effectively.

Dueling Beetles:
- Mode: Hot Zone
- Has indestructive walls: Yes
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Meeple | Berry | Hank | Stu
- Last Pick: Barley | Sprout | Mortis | Kenji | Cordelius | Buster | Ollie | Lou | Meeple | Berry | Hank | Stu
- Other Picks: Bea | Griff | Poco | Penny | Melodie | Gus | Maisie | Frank | Janet | Draco | Gray | Mr. P | Byron | Squeak | Belle | Surge | Carl | Ollie | Lou | Meeple | Berry | Hank | Stu
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Dueling Beetles in Hot Zone, the meta is fast-paced and chaotic, with constant gadget spam being key to success. The best brawlers on this map are Ollie, Lou, and Meeple. Ollie is a top pick, with his ability to jump over walls, making him highly mobile and capable of disrupting enemy setups. Hank is another dominant choice, being able to shoot through walls and wipe teams with his Hypercharge, making him a must-ban or priority pick. Meeple might be surprising, but his dice gadget spam is incredibly effective at boxing enemies in, and with his recent reload buff, he deals significant damage. Berry is absolutely broken on any Hot Zone map (specially paired with tanks in his team because of his healing ability), and if played correctly, he can almost guarantee victory by sustaining control in the zone. Stu remains a solid pick but is getting countered more frequently due to the rise of Berry, Poco, Frank, and Draco, who thrive in Hot Zone’s time-based gameplay. Unlike other modes, Hot Zone is not about eliminating enemies but about staying in the zone for as long as possible. A major mistake players make is picking too many snipers like Belle and Bea, or Gus and Belle, thinking that eliminating enemies constantly will secure control. However, since enemies keep respawning and retaking the zone, these compositions often fail. If the enemy team consists of two or three snipers, it becomes possible to counter them with brute-force comps like Frank and Gray (with the strategy of using a teleport so that Frank can go to the area all the time) or Draco and Byron, which allow players to stay in the zone for extended periods despite frequent deaths. Griff is an excellent pick, countering Lou, Penny, and tanks effectively by opening up the map with gadget spam. His super damage buff from a few months ago further solidifies his viability. Bea is another strong pick when paired with Griff or when utilizing gadget spam to apply pressure. Melodie is one of the best Hot Zone brawlers right now, excelling against tanks due to her ability to charge Hypercharge rapidly. Once she gets Hypercharge, she can easily wipe entire teams, especially with her shield gadget. Maisie is another critical pick, as she serves as one of the few reliable counters to the excessive Draco and Frank picks in the current meta, especially on open maps. Janet is also an extremely strong pick, offering utility, mobility, and control. Mr. P is viable later in the draft but only if the enemy team does not have too many aggressive brawlers, as he lacks the DPS to deal with high-pressure situations. As for late picks, Mortis can be a situational counter if the enemy team consists of too many control brawlers. Sprout is another viable last-pick option, as he can be devastating against control-heavy enemy compositions and counter throwers effectively. The key to success on Dueling Beetles is ensuring that the team has at least one aggressive brawler to push forward and force the enemy back, rather than relying too much on control-based strategies that can be overwhelmed by aggressive, zone-holding compositions.

Open Bussines:
- Mode: Hot Zone
- Has indestructive walls: No
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Berry | Meeple | Hank | Stu
- Last Pick: Carl | Jacky | Mortis | Kenji | Squeak | Shade | Ollie | Lou | Berry | Meeple | Hank | Stu
- Other Picks: Bea | Griff | Poco | Penny | Juju | Melodie | Janet | Maisie | Frank | Gray | Draco | Larry | Barley | Mr. P | Nita | Gus | Surge | Cordelius | Ollie | Lou | Berry | Meeple | Hank | Stu
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Open Business in Hot Zone, the meta revolves around holding control of the zone for as long as possible rather than focusing on eliminations. Gadget spam is crucial, with many brawlers relying on abilities that allow them to zone enemies out, sustain in the hot zone, or apply pressure without direct combat. The best brawlers on this map are Ollie, Lou, and Meeple. Ollie is a top pick, with his ability to jump over walls, making him highly mobile and capable of disrupting enemy setups. Hank is another dominant choice, being able to shoot through walls and wipe teams with his Hypercharge, making him a must-ban or priority pick. Meeple might be surprising, but his dice gadget spam is incredibly effective at boxing enemies in, and with his recent reload buff, he deals significant damage. Berry is absolutely broken on any Hot Zone map (specially paired with tanks in his team because of his healing ability), and if played correctly, he can almost guarantee victory by sustaining control in the zone. The strongest picks include Frank, who dominates with his Hypercharge, as it allows him to break walls and force opponents out of the zone. Griff is one of the best counters to Frank and tanks in general, as he can open the map with gadget spam and kill them with his super, making it harder for enemies like Lou, Penny, or other tanks to maintain control. Berry remains one of the most broken brawlers in Hot Zone, as his ability to sustain in the zone and deal consistent pressure makes him nearly unstoppable when played correctly. Janet thrives on this map, especially with Hypercharge, as it allows her to deal consistent damage while maintaining mobility and pressure. One of the biggest threats on this map is the risk of getting spawn-trapped—if a team loses the first few engagements, they will struggle to regain control, as many strong brawlers can hold the zone indefinitely. This makes aggressive and tanky brawlers extremely valuable, as they can push up early and force enemies into defensive positions. Maisie is an underrated but highly effective pick, as she serves as one of the few reliable counters to aggressive tanks like Frank and Draco, which are extremely common in this mode. Throwers like Larry and Barley are risky picks in this meta, as they can counter control-based compositions but are easily overrun by aggressive, Hypercharge-heavy brawlers. They are best selected as late picks if the enemy team lacks aggressive brawlers and consists mostly of controllers. Mortis can also be a viable late-pick option, but only if the enemy team has multiple control-based brawlers that don’t break walls and lack aggressive threats—otherwise, he will struggle. Shade is a surprisingly effective pick, capable of dealing with many threats in this mode if they do not have brawlers to break the walls, while Jacky has become more viable due to her recent gadget changes, making her a strong option for contesting the zone. The best drafting strategy on Open Business involves prioritizing brawlers that can maintain control through sustain, gadget spam, and aggressive pressure, while ensuring that the team can avoid getting spawn-trapped and countering Hypercharge-heavy strategies.

Parallel Plays:
- Mode: Hot Zone
- Has indestructive walls: Yes
- 1st Pick: Ollie | Hank | R-T | Meeple | Stu | Lou
- Last Pick: Dynamike | Jacky | Mortis | Kenji | Squeak | Chuck | Lily | Ollie | Hank | R-T | Meeple | Stu | Lou
- Other picks: Berry | Juju | Janet | Penny | Bea | Melodie | Mr. P | Larry | Cordelius | Maisie | Barley | Byron | Poco | Kit | Surge | Shade | Leon | Carl | Ollie | Hank | R-T | Meeple | Stu | Lou
- Estrategy: On Parallel Plays in Hot Zone, the meta follows the same principles as other Hot Zone maps, where holding the zone is more important than eliminations, with heavy reliance on gadget spam, Hypercharges, and sustain. The best strategy involves sending two brawlers to the left side and one to the right; once the left side is secured, rotate to assist the right side. Aggressive brawlers are needed for the right zone, while defensive options like throwers or tank counters should control the left, and a pinch-supporting brawler can play mid. The best brawlers on this map are Ollie, Lou, and Meeple. Ollie is a top pick, with his ability to jump over walls, making him highly mobile and capable of disrupting enemy setups. Hank is another dominant choice, being able to shoot through walls and wipe teams with his Hypercharge, making him a must-ban or priority pick. Meeple might be surprising, but his dice gadget spam is incredibly effective at boxing enemies in, and with his recent reload buff, he deals significant damage. Berry is absolutely broken on any Hot Zone map (specially paired with tanks in his team because of his healing ability), and if played correctly, he can almost guarantee victory by sustaining control in the zone. R-T excels as a defensive brawler, using his gadget to gain free supers and effectively counter aggressive opponents. Lou is one of the strongest Hot Zone picks, controlling zones effectively with his freeze mechanics. Meeple is excellent, as his super can shoot through unbreakable walls, making him extremely valuable for area control. Berry is broken in Hot Zone, excelling when paired with aggressive tanks or assassins, enabling them to push forward while providing zone dominance. Juju and Melodie remain excellent picks, with Melodie thriving due to her fast Hypercharge cycle and ability to wipe teams. Throwers are important, but you should not draft two throwers in the same composition; Mr. P is a strong pick, as he pins enemies down with his turrets and becomes oppressive once he gets Hypercharge. Shade is an underrated but effective pick, providing strong pressure. Leon can work as a surprise late pick, especially if the enemy lacks strong scouting options. Chuck is an incredibly strong pick when set up correctly, as his super allows for uncontested rotations—his only real counters are Cordelius and R-T. Without a hard counter, Chuck dominates. Max, while less common than before, is still a solid late pick for team mobility. Jacky is highly viable with her speed gadget, allowing her to constantly push into the zone. Lily can also be a good option due to her ability to apply constant pressure. The key to success on this map is following the optimal team rotation: send two brawlers left while one holds right; once the left side is secured, rotate to assist the right side, ensuring full map control and consistent pressure.
