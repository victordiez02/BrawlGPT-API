- Estrategy: The optimal brawler selections should prioritize vision gear utility, range advantage, and mid-lane control. The best choice for this map is Janet, as her vision gear allows her to dominate lanes by outranging many opponents. Her hypercharge charges extremely fast, giving her significant burst potential, especially against gem carriers, since she can pressure with aerial attacks and quickly eliminate threats. For mid-lane control, Penny is an excellent choice due to her range and splash damage, making her highly effective in controlling the map. Gene and 8-Bit are also strong picks in this role, as they scout efficiently with their projectiles and vision gear. Pearl and Amber are standard Gem Grab brawlers, excelling in sustained mid-lane fights. On long-range lanes, Lola is highly underrated, benefiting from vision gear to win most matchups. However, Penny and Amber can counter her effectively. Stu and Max require precise execution; Max, in particular, is punishing if not played optimally. Lou is viable both as a lane brawler and in mid, leveraging his reload speed and control abilities. Snipers like Piper remain viable as late picks, especially as counters to enemy gem carriers. However, they should be chosen strategically in later draft phases rather than as initial picks. For counterplay, Mortis, Darryl, and Squeak can be annoying but are not overpowered in this map. For the "Undermine" Gem Grab map, the best picks will vary, but the general principles of vision control, mid-lane dominance, and range advantage remain crucial for success.

- Estrategy: On Center Stage in Brawl Ball, the current meta heavily revolves around Ollie and Hank, who are the best brawlers in the game and should always be either banned or prioritized. They are even very good options even if we are not in phase 1. Hank with Hypercharge is incredibly dominant, capable of wiping an entire team, especially when paired with a wall-breaker; even if he dies multiple times, once he gets Hypercharge, he can easily turn the game around. Ollie, after his recent buff, is incredibly strong due to his jump gadget and super, allowing him to create massive space by quickly traversing the map and hypnotizing enemies for 3.5 seconds if he lands after using his gadget, making him extremely difficult to counter. Lou is another strong pick due to his ability to provide strong control. The recommended draft strategy is to pick a control brawler, an anti-tank, and either an assassin or a tank, which is particularly important in Brawl Ball. Berry is a great option, especially when paired with high-HP brawlers, allowing him to pop off effectively, but he is less effective at lower ranks or when playing with randoms, as teammates may not position correctly to get the most value out of his super. Stu is a strong choice but can struggle against Poco and brawlers with gadget spam. Griff is rising in popularity due to his ability to counter tanks effectively with his gadget. Otis is particularly effective on this map when equipped with the vision gear, making him a strong lane pick. Sandy, while being slightly outranged by other lane brawlers, remains a flexible pick due to his ability to charge his super against tanks and provide strong area control once it's active. Maisie is excellent as a cleanup brawler, especially when used to finish off weakened enemies. Meeple can be a solid choice if paired with anti-tank brawlers. Rosa, when picked late in the draft and equipped with the Grow gadget, can be very effective in controlling certain areas of the map. El Primo is a strong counter to certain assassins and other tanks, making him a viable situational pick. Additionally, Ruffs has become more viable again due to the return of strong gadget utility. The best approach to drafting on this map is to focus on wall-breakers, anti-tanks, and strong lane control brawlers while considering how to counter enemy tanks and assassins effectively.

Pinball Dreams:

- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Juju
- Last Pick: Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Juju | Melodie | Dynamike | Frank | Kenji | El Primo | Shade

- Estrategy: On Pinball Dreams, Ollie is undoubtedly the best brawler due to his ability to instantly use his jump gadget to engage throwers or lane brawlers, almost guaranteeing a kill if he lands on them while also creating massive space. Lou remains an essential pick to counter tanks effectively. Stu is still versatile despite being slightly countered in the current meta, as he can break walls and continuously charge his super against tanks and other brawlers. Bea is an exceptionally strong choice on this map, especially with Rattled Hive and Hypercharge; while the Hypercharge is not essential, the gadget spam makes her even more oppressive. Hank is another top-tier pick, capable of high-impact plays. Juju and Max provide excellent counterplay, particularly against Bea and other mid-range brawlers. Griff remains one of the best anti-tank options in the game, with his gadget enabling him to break walls and counter picks like throwers or Rico, making him highly effective when paired with Bea or another long-range brawler. Additionally, there is room for cheesy compositions such as Poco and Frank, which can overwhelm opponents if they lack the damage output to stop them. However, an important draft rule is to avoid picking two low-DPS brawlers, as that will allow the enemy to run down compositions with Poco and a tank, Bea and a tank, or Max and a tank, which are all viable strategies. Likewise, if they play brawlers with low DPS, these will be good options to respond, as long as we are in an advanced phase. Last-pick throwers like Dynamike can work well, while Melodie is also a very strong last-pick option in the current meta. Shade has become more viable with recent gadget changes, adding another possible pick. Rico is becoming less effective, while Maisie is benefiting from this shift in the meta. To succeed on this map, prioritize aggressive initiators, anti-tank options, and mid-range control brawlers while being mindful of enemy team compositions that can exploit low DPS setups.

Sneaky Fields:

- 1st Pick: Ollie | Lou | Stu | Bea | Hank | Janet
- Last Pick: Melodie | Carl | Frank | Kenji | El Primo | Rosa
- Other Picks: Max | Griff | Meeple | Nita | Spike | Poco | Ash | Maisie | Sandy | Berry | Squeak | Otis | Surge | Ruffs | Juju | Draco | Rico | Mr. P
- Mid: aaaa
- Lane: bbbb
- Estrategy: On Sneaky Fields, the current meta heavily revolves around Ollie being an exceptional pick due to his jump gadget, allowing him to engage throwers or lane brawlers and secure kills while creating immense space. Hank is very dominant, especially when he has Hypercharge, as he can wipe entire teams, making him a priority pick or ban. Bea is extremely strong on this map when using the Vision Gear and Rattled Hive, providing massive lane coverage; failing to include at least one brawler with Vision Gear is a major mistake, as it allows opponents to dominate the bushes and control the map. Janet is another top-tier pick due to her Vision Gear and scouting gadget, giving her excellent bush control. Meeple is very strong in high-level play on this map but needs to be paired with a tank to maximize effectiveness. Spike is a surprising but effective pick, especially when using the Fertilize ability, as the mapâ€™s closed lanes ensure he consistently lands shots, making him a solid anti-tank and providing healing sustain. Tanks are generally strong here, with Ash being incredibly dominant. Poco is an excellent counter to Lou when using Protective Tunes, and he synergizes well with Max due to his healing spam, allowing sustained pressure. Sandy is making a comeback as a viable pick, offering strong control and synergy with tanks. Squeak is highly effective as a later draft pick, especially with the Windup gadget, allowing him to apply immense pressure. Ruffs remains valuable due to his ability to spam supers and open up the map, countering short-range casters or brawlers and even Rico. The same applies to Griff with his gagdet that allows him to break all walls. Last-pick options include Jacky, who can capitalize on her speed gadget, and El Primo, who serves as a reliable counter to enemy tanks, always checking that there are no enemy brawlers that counter them. Melodie is another powerful choice, particularly in the hands of skilled players who can maximize her Hypercharge potential. Overall, the best draft approach on this map involves securing strong lane control, vision-based picks to counter bush-dependent strategies, and a balanced composition that includes a mix of tanks, anti-tank brawlers, and aggressive playmakers.
