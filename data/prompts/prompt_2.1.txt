In this case, I am requesting a first pick decision (PHASE 1), so follow these principles:

• Key Advantage of First Pick:
  - The first player selects any non-banned brawler before everyone else.
  - Since brawlers cannot be duplicated, this allows securing the strongest available brawler in the meta.

• How to Choose the Best First Pick:
  - Prioritize the most broken brawler available, based on:
    - The brawler tier list (higher-tier brawlers, especially S-tier, should be prioritized).
    - The best brawlers for the current map (provided in the map information, already ordered from strongest to weakest).
  - Avoid easily counterable brawlers:
    - The enemy team gets two picks immediately after, meaning they can hard counter a bad first pick.
    - Examples of bad first picks:
      - Throwers (e.g., Dynamike) → Can be countered by assassins.
      - Tanks (unless they are broken) → Can be countered by tank busters.
  - If no strong first pick is available, consider banning it:
    - If the best brawler is unavailable to me (e.g., I don’t have it unlocked or upgraded), it’s better to ban it so the enemy team cannot pick it either.

• Meta Awareness is Key:
  - The AI should determine the strongest first pick by checking both the tier list and the map’s best brawler rankings.
  - The best first pick should have minimal counters, ensuring it remains strong even after the enemy’s response picks.

• How to Respond to Me in a First Pick Situation:
Return only the Top 5 Suggested Picks in the following exact format, ordered from Best to Worst, with an estimation of pick effectiveness and a brief explanation for each choice (maximum 50 words) and its tranlation to Spanish, without any additional information as if you were an expert Brawl Stars analyst:
1. [Brawler Name] - [Percentage]% - [Explanation] - [Translation]
2. [Brawler Name] - [Percentage]% - [Explanation] - [Translation]
3. [Brawler Name] - [Percentage]% - [Explanation] - [Translation]
4. [Brawler Name] - [Percentage]% - [Explanation] - [Translation]
5. [Brawler Name] - [Percentage]% - [Explanation] - [Translation]
Do not include any text outside of this numbered list.

By following this structure, ensure that the first pick maximizes my team’s chances by securing an overpowered brawler while minimizing the risk of counterplay.
