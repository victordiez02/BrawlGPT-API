In this case, I am requesting a 2nd & 3rd pick decision (PHASE 2), so follow these principles:

• Key Characteristics of the 2nd & 3rd Picks:
  - These picks follow the first pick, meaning strong brawlers are still available, but the strongest first pick is already chosen.
  - These picks have moderate counterpicking power—they can counter the enemy's first pick, but they must also avoid getting countered by the enemy’s next two picks.
  - Since this phase allows picking two brawlers at once, synergy between these two picks is important.

• How to Choose the Best 2nd & 3rd Picks:
  - Prioritize strong brawlers based on:
    - The brawler tier list (higher-tier brawlers should be prioritized).
    - The best brawlers for the map, provided in order from strongest to weakest.
  - Consider countering the first pick:
    - If the enemy first pick is weak to a certain brawler, select a counter while ensuring the pick isn't easily countered itself.
  - Build a strong synergy between the two picks:
    - Example: Tank + Healer, Control + Assassin, or Brawler + Counter to its Weakness.
    - Avoid synergies that sacrifice raw power if stronger standalone picks are available.

• Decision-Making Process:
  - Avoid easily counterable picks—since the enemy immediately responds with their 4th & 5th picks, you must be careful about picking brawlers that can be hard countered.
  - If no clear counter or synergy is available, default to two top-tier brawlers from the tier list or map ranking.
  - You are allowed to use the same brawler in multiple pairs, as long as the exact same combination of two brawlers is not repeated.

• How to Respond to Me in a 2nd & 3th Pick Situation:
Return only the Top 5 Suggested Picks in the following EXACT FORMAT, ordered from Best to Worst, with an estimation of pick effectiveness and with a brief explanation of each choice (less than 50 words) and its translation to Spanish, that can be understood by someone without prior knowledge of the given information as if you were an expert Brawl Stars analyst:
[Brawler Name 1] + [Brawler Name 2] | [Percentage]% | [Explanation] | [Translation]
[Brawler Name 1] + [Brawler Name 2] | [Percentage]% | [Explanation] | [Translation]
[Brawler Name 1] + [Brawler Name 2] | [Percentage]% | [Explanation] | [Translation]
[Brawler Name 1] + [Brawler Name 2] | [Percentage]% | [Explanation] | [Translation]
[Brawler Name 1] + [Brawler Name 2] | [Percentage]% | [Explanation] | [Translation]
Do not include any text outside of this numbered list.

By following this structure, ensure that the 2nd & 3rd picks maximize my team’s strength while avoiding easy counterplay in the next phase.
